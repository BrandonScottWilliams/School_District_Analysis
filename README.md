# School_District_Analysis_Challenge
PyCitySchools with Pandas

## Overview of the Analysis
A school district  needed assistance with allocating funds and making decisions regarding their schools based on performance. They asked for a snapshot of several key metrics by each school campus and by the district level.  The analysis focused on the performance of math and reading scores being compared in different ways. After external issues, we have been asked to redo the analysis but first removing the subset of data from 9th graders at Thomas High School.

## Results

* How is the district summary affected?
We can see that the average pass rate fell for both reading and math when Thomas High School grade 9 results were removed.
